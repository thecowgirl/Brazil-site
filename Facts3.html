            Down in the Capital of Brazil is Rio. Rio is a very populated city and is full of amazing people. <br>
            These people have learned to live their own life and to be totally happy and they have a sense of <br>
            comunity. These people are very strong and are good people. They look out for one another. This <br>
            place also has a lot of really cool stuff to do here, hiking, bird watching, hang gliding, ect. <br>
            And what would Rio be without their biggest, most wild, and grand parade, Carnaval! <br>
            This is where the whole city celabrates in a grand parade! It is truly beautiful. <br>

               Rio is one of the most unimaganably beautiful places on earth with a wide range of atractions, <br>
               nature, and culture. People here are so welcoming and they are amazing people who are happy even when <br>
               they don't have much. People here learn how to make their own fun and they know how to keep busy. <br>
               There is an old man who lives on the outskerts of the city in one of the many, many, suberbs and he <br>
               made his own garden with all the trash that floods the city. It is truly inspiring and it is so creative. <br>
