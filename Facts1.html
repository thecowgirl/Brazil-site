                This is only one of the many, many unique birds that live in the <br>
                Rainforest. Almost all of the birds that live in the Amazon Rainforest <br>
                are very colorful and preform a variety of amazing dances and put much <br>
                effort to atract attention so that they might get a mate. Some birds even <br>
                clear the ground of twigs and leaves and set out a place for the femail to <br>
                sit just like a stage! It's great yet harsh compatition out here where life <br>
                is so abundant. <br>

                From the sky to the trees where the endangered Golden Monkey makes its home. <br>
                These beautiful Golden Monkeys are one of a kind. They are endangered because <br>
                of lose of habbitat. These little bundles of energy have a very unique coat that <br>
                is a almost a golden color and like all Monkeys these guys are very social. <br>
                As they live in the trees they also live with other Golden Monkeys, playing and <br>
                climing all day long.

                From they sky to the trees and now we leep down on to the grassy moist grownd and <br>
                a little further down into the cool river. Rivers run throughout the entir forest <br>
                and they might seem safe and cool and quite refreshing, but beneith the surface is <br>
                a much more lively yet deadly sene. Paranas, bactiria, aligators, and all sorts of <br>
                other fish and little creatures swiming through the river. Although when you go to <br>
                the edge of the river when it comes to empty in the ocean you can find baby sharks <br>
                rowming through the shalow shores and sea turtles weaving thier way through the roots <br>
                of near by trees and bramble.
